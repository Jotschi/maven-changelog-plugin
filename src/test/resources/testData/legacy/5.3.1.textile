WARNING: *Optional manual change* A new Aloha Editor major version was added

Added new Version 0.10 of Aloha Editor to Gentics Content.Node, which brings a load of new features like plugin bundles, dependency loading with requirejs and other improvements to your editing experience. Please refer to http://www.github.com/alohaeditor/Aloha-Editor or http://www.aloha-editor.org for additional and more detailed information.

Aloha Editor 0.10 may be activated by setting $FEATURE["aloha010"] = true; and $FEATURE["aloha"] = true; in your node.conf. You may continue to use Aloha Editor 0.9.3 though without enabling the new feature.

WARNING: *Manual Changes* The Aloha Editor plugin API was changed

# Aloha Editor 0.10 will no longer expose it's internal jQuery object through the $ and/or jQuery variables. You have to include your own version of jQuery if you relied on Aloha Editor's version prior to this update.

# The "GENTICS_" prefix for CSS class names has been replaced by "aloha-". If you targeted those specific class names in your implementation those need to be updated.

# The "GENTICS.Aloha" namespace for Aloha Editor's JavaScript objects has been reduced to "Aloha" alone.


*Please note:*

# If you want to edit your pages using Aloha Editor a valid doctype has to be specified.

# As the plugin system has been fully rewritten in Aloha Editor 0.10 plugins you wrote for 0.9.3 will not work with the new version. <a href="/Content.Node/infoportal/cms/Configuring-Aloha-Plugins-in-Gentics-Content.Node.en.php">See our documentation on how to edit plugin settings</a>.

Added parameter "versioninfo" to REST API call /rest/page/load/ to get version information

h4. !images/changelog_types/enhancement_24.png! *Enhancement*

Resolving node tags in custom-forms only worked in the tag-fill dialogue
of content tags (pages). For template tags (templates) or tag-types, the
entire custom-form was rendered as the empty string if the
customform_resolve_nodetags feature was activated.

Now, if the custom-form is rendered as part of the tag-fill dialogue for
template tags or tag-types, all  will resolve to the empty
string. Special custom-form tags (e.g. <nodename>) will be resolved
normally.
