WARNING: *Manual change* The FTP configuration within the node settings was removed. Please use scheduler tasks instead.

Here is an example task template that will sync a Node and the GenticsImageStore folder for that node:

<shell>
/Node/bin/lftp -u "%user%,%password%" -e "mirror -R -L -e /Node/node/content/publish/pub/%ordner.node.host%%ordner.node.pub_dir% ./%wwwRoot%%ordner.node.pub_dir%;mirror -R -L -e /Node/node/content/publish/pub/%ordner.node.host%/GenticsImageStore ./%wwwRoot%/GenticsImageStore;exit" %targetHost% 2>&1
</shell>

WARNING: *Manual change* Fixed page-import doesn't fill parts with cn_value keyword bug

The previous behaviour during a page import filled either a visible or
editable part of an imported tag with the element contents. When the
feature cn_page_import_fill_editable_part was true, an editable part was
filled. Otherwise a visible part was filled.

This behaviour was contrary to the documentation, which states that the part with keyword "cn_value" is filled with the element contents.

The behaviour was fixed, so that "cn_value" will be filled, if it exists. If no such part exists, the import will fall-back to the old behaviour.

All tag-types that are used with the page-import must be checked for compatibility with the new behaviour. It must be ensured that, if there is a part with keyword "cn_value" in a tag-type, that it really is the
part that should be filled during page-import, and not one of the other editable or visible parts.

Fixed security issues.

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Fixed non-transactional delete of tagtypes that caused data inconsistency.

When a tagtype was deleted, it was possible that template-tags or content-tags referring to the tagtype were left in the system, causing problems with the import/export feature.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Fixed system messages when a page is put back into revision.
Only the ID of the pages that were put into revision were shown in the system message, now the name (incl. full path) + ID are shown.
Additionally, too many messages were sent to the editor of the page: one message that lists all pages, and one additional messaeg for each page. Now, only the first message, that lists all pages, will be sent.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Fixed url generation within imagemanipulation2. Previously image/css/js urls were only working within cms and not within the portal.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

<p>Fixed omissions in user list when pages are being assigned for revision.</p>
<p>A previous fix to disable the paging of the list in the "assign for revision" dialog caused some users to be omitted from the list.</p>

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Fixed rare case when filename is ~62 characters long and the automatically added file extension was cutted (example: *.php -> *.ph)<br/>It now cuts the filename first so the file extensions always can be fully added.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/enhancement_24.png! *Enhancement*

The LDAP login field for groups can now be mapped with a string which should match the description of the appropriate CMS group.  

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Fixed the "publish" menu entries not being shown in the page menu when it was shown in the page list context menu (inconsistent behavior). It is now always shown.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/enhancement_24.png! *Enhancement*

The default maximum size of tag-values has been increased to from 100KB to 1MB.<br/>


This maximum is only in effect if the validation feature is turned on and configured correctly. The setting may be changed in the antisamy.custom.xml with the maxInputSize directive.

See "this article":http://www.gentics.com/Content.Node/infoportal/cms/wiki/Validation.en.php for more information about the validation feature.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Fixed bug in GenticsImageStore which sometimes didn't round calculcated proportional widths or heights of images correctly when doing image resizing.<br/>

Example: 
<shell>
/CNPortletapp/GenticsImageStore/150/auto/cropandresize/prop/22/0/964/674/
</shell>

The resulting proportional height has been 104,87... which was incorrectly cutted down to 104px instead of 105px

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Fixed: opening a WebDAV folder didn't work with some OS and browser configurations<br/>

WebDAV folders are now opened with the IE Web Folder API. On Windows 7
IE8 file:// URLs are still used as the Web Folder API didn't work in
this configuration. The three methods to open a WebDAV folder are

# folder is opened automatically immediately on clicking open on a folder in the tree
# folder is opened by clicking the "here" link
# folder is opened by copying the "here" link and pasting it manually into a new browser window

These three methods were tested and work in the following configurations:

# Windows XP IE7
# Windows XP IE8
# Windows 7 IE8
# Windows 7 IE9

To force the use of the Web Folders API the feature webdav_use_file_url can be set to false (default true).
To force the old behaviour of opening WebDAV folders the feature webdav_use_web_folders can be set to false (default true).
The default is to use the Web Folders API except on Windows Vista IE8 and Windows 7 IE8.

If opening a folder doesn't work on Vista or Windows 7, try installing "this update":http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=15123
