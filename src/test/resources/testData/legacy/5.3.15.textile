Permissions on the root folder of a node are handled incorrectly

There are usually two entries in the perm table for the root folder of a node: an entry with o_type = T_FOLDER and an entry with o_type = T_NODE (both with o_id = <folder id of the node>). The bug was caused by a missing T_NODE entry.

A quick workaround for this bug is clicking OK once on the page that lists the permissions for the root folder of a node.

When pages are published no notification messages are sent.

Notifications were only sent when a page was published from the publish-queue. Notifications were not sent when the user clicked on the page in the publish-queue, or navigated to the page, and published it
outside of the publish-queue page (through the page-menu for example).

The new behaviour will always send notifications, no matter where the page is published or saved (put into revision), as long as the page is visible in the publish queue.

SQLException during CRSync causes inconsistency

When a SQLException occurred during the attribute-prefetching phase of a CRSync, some attributes were not synced correctly.

The inconsistency can be repaired by updating the objects in the source repository.

The bug was fixed by aborting the CRSync should an Exception occur during the attribute-prefetching phase.

Viewing the differences between two version of a Page takes very long

An inefficient regex in the code that implements the DaisyDiff algorithm caused the Page that shows the differences to take a long time to load.

----

The DaisyDiff algorithm is now only used for pages with the text/html mimetype

Saving pages with the REST API will ignore selected options

Saving the selection of single-select and multi-select part is now implemented.
