h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Fixed errors that were caused by missing folder or template objects during
a publishrun with versioned publishing enabled.

Versioned publishing will render and publish the published content of
pages that are included in other pages, for example via an Overview, or
a Tag (page), or similar TagTypes that can include content from other
pages, or via a Page variant.

<p>Additionally, there were some changes concerning the versioning of pages.</p>

<p>First, the folder of a page has ben excluded from versioning. This means
that the page will always be rendered in its current folder. For
example, Changelog will render the name of the current folder
even in an older version of the page. Before this change, the name of
the folder where the page was when the version was created was renderd.</p>

<p>Second, the template of a page is still versioned, but should the
template of an older version of the page have been deleted, the current
template will be used as a fallback and a warning will be logged. To
avoid this, never delete a template that may be used by older versions
of a page.</p>

<p>These changes apply even when the versioned publishing feature is turned
off.</p>
