Fixed a css bug with editicons in Firefox, where icons would have an unwanted offset. Also added zero border with to images within tagicons to prevent them from being outlined when inside an anchor tag. Therefore the following css classes have been changed: ".GENTICS_block .aloha-editicons button" (added borders and background) and .GENTICS_block .aloha-editicons button img (added border 0px).
