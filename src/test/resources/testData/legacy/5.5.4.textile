h2. Changes with Gentics Content.Node 5.5.4

endprologue.

----

WARNING: *Manual Change* Handling of enabled aloha plugin setting was changed.

Previously loading of some plugins was omitted when the generated php array of the node.conf CUSTOM_ALOHA_PLUGINS array already contained entries that were included in the ALOHA_PLUGINS_GLOBAL. It is now no longer needed to touch the ALOHA_PLUGINS_GLOBAL variable. The array_unique and array_merge invocation can now be omitted. The CUSTOM_ALOHA_PLUGINS array will now automatically be merged with the ALOHA_PLUGINS_GLOBAL array. See "this guides page":http://www.gentics.com/Content.Node/guides/aloha_gcn_plugins.html for more information.

The new feature "aloha_annotate_editables" enables annotation of DOM elements, that are root tags of editables in Aloha. They will get the following classes: GENTICS_construct_[constructkeyword] GENTICS_tagname_[tagname] GENTICS_tagpart_[partkeyword] GENTICS_parttype_[parttype].

----

Searches in the MiniBrowser will now be done recursively.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/enhancement_24.png! *Enhancement*

The page delete action will now no longer take multiple minutes for completion on large systems. Previously a check for page variations caused the deletion action to stall while the check was in progress. The check is now optimized. 

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/enhancement_24.png! *Enhancement*

The details lists for pages, images, files, templates and folders in the channelsync dialog now shows more information.

-----

h4. !images/changelog_types/enhancement_24.png! *Enhancement*

The selfupdate logout link will now open in the correct frame.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Fixed clearing caches when deleting tagtypes that were used in pages, templates or object properties.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Fixed display of pages that have language variants in nodes that have no languages, when multichannelling is used. Instead of showing all language variants as separate pages, only one language variant is shown (like when no multichannelling is used). 

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

The construct load method will now return an ordered set of construct categories and constructs. Previously those entries were not ordered. Constructs (Tagtypes) will be ordered alphabetically and construct categories will be ordered by the specified sortorder. Additionally this method will now only return constructs that can be inserted into other tags. Please use the list method if you want to list all tagtypes/constructs. Please note that the functionality of the load method will be moved into the list method at some time in the future.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Fixed layout for page timemanagement in Internet Explorer where weekdays would not always have the checkboxes right next to them.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

When a page is modified and then placed into the publish queue - without explicitly clicking 'save' first - no new page version was created. When the page was finally published by another user, a page version was created, but incorrectly assigned to the publishing user, not the editor. This behaviour has been fixed now. Placing a page in the publish queue will now always create a new page version, if necessary.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Removed debug output line left in the file uploader by mistake.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Fixed Inbox Messages for pages sent to the publish queue, where the page link was missing for pages with IDs greater than 999.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

The timeout for queries in the repository browser of the tagfill dialog has been raised to 60 seconds.

----


h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Fixed redirecting requests to /CNPortletapp/latest/alohaeditor... to URLs containing the timestamp of the latest Aloha Editor Build to support probably existing proxyprefix, that is used when accessing Aloha Editor via a ProxyServlet for use in frontend editing.
Since frontend editing only works, if the new Feature "redirect_check_referer" is turned on, this feature is now activated by default.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

The tree will now be updated correctly when switching pages using quickjump.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

This update will start a background job (when the tomcat is started), that fixes the page versions (where possible) to be compatible with versioned publishing.
It may, however, occur that pages that have not been modified for a very long time do not provide enough data to fix the page version accordingly. For those pages, re-publishing will
still behave like before the feature "versioned publishing" until they are manually republished once.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Assistant frame will now be properly shown after being hidden by the tagfill dialog.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Fixed resolving problem when rendering nested velocity tags in a special way: When e.g. resolving $cms.folder.startpage.url.tags.[tagname] in a Velocity Tag of a page, where the folder startpage
resolves to another page, the resolved tag [tagname] was rendered in the scope of the first page, not of the page really containing the tag. As a result, resolving of $cms.page in the tag [tagname]
returned the outer page, not the page containing the tag [tagname], like expected.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Split translation view will now have appropriate window size in Internet Explorer

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Fixed uploading files via the gcnfileupload Plugin in Aloha Editor, via the PHP uploader or via WebDAV in local channel folders. The uploaded files will now always belong to the correct channel.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

When using the Channel Synchronization to push objects into a master node, check for objects that are contained in folders that do not exist in the master (local folders in the channel). Those objects are no longer pushed
to the master, but the user is informed about the inability to push them.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Fixed incorrect assignment of folders to channels, when pushing localized/local folders from a channel to a higher channel (which is not the master node). As a result, it was e.g. impossible to set a startpage of such folders.
This fix includes repairing of the incorrect data in the database.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Fixed SGB that sometimes occurred when trying to push local objects into a master node.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Fixed the datasource usage overview listing sometimes not showing results when a filter was set in the main datasource list.
It now doesn't use that filter anymore and shows all results in the usage list.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Added new configuration setting $MAILRETURNPATH, that should be set to a valid eMail address, so that mails sent from Java processes are not blocked by the receiving mail server.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Fixed the failure handling when editing Pages with Aloha Editor. If an AJAX Request get's an error, the default error handling will show a message to the user now.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Fixed rendering of page URLs when rendering pages in edit or preview mode. Links to CSS or JS pages will always be for the live preview. Otherwise, when rendering in real preview or real edit mode, the links will go to real preview. When rendering preview or edit mode (with or without Aloha Editor), the links will go to preview mode.
This fixes problems with the main menu, when following a link to another page (main menu was not working any more).

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

When multiple pages are published in a single action, they will not be written into the contentrepositories, even if instant publishing is activated. This will avoid possible browser timeouts, when writing many pages
into their contentrepositories takes a long time. Only if a single page is published, instant publishing will be done (if activated).

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Fixed instant publishing in connection with multichannelling. When instant publishing was activated for the ContentRepository of a master node and an object was published in a channel, the object was instantly published into the master node's ContentRepository.
Additionally, there are two new maintenance actions in the list of ContentRepositories to check CR's for incorrectly published data and to remove this data.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Fixed file opening behaviour for non-image filetypes. Previously videos and other non-image filetypes were automatically opened in external programs. Those files could not be loaded in external programms since the session cookie is not beeing shared between the browser and the external programs. Non-image files will now be downloaded by the browser. They can be used by external programs once the download is completed.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Fixed the table plugin in live editor not taking the resized width & height of tables into account when editing a table again.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Fixed clearing caches, when a page's content is locked/unlocked (when editing a page without using Aloha Editor). Before this fix, it sometimes occurred, that after saving (and unlocking) a page, it was incorrectly still shown as being locked in the pages list.

----

NOTE: For changes to Aloha Editor please see the "Aloha Editor Changelog":https://github.com/alohaeditor/Aloha-Editor/blob/fb54e9b47c34bc8517290d2be491c20cff67c43b/CHANGELOG.md . This Gentics Content.Node version includes the Aloha Editor 0.20.15 - 2012/06/27.
