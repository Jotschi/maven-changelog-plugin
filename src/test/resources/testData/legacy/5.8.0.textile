WARNING: *Manual Change* Aloha Editor 0.20.x was removed from GCN

Aloha Editor 0.20.x was removed from Gentics Content.Node. Now only the latest version of Aloha Editor will be included.

The features __aloha__ , __aloha_010__ and __aloha_jqueryui__ are no longer being used and should be removed from the node.conf configuration file.

----

WARNING: *Manual Change* The function descriptor of the function PageAPI.createTag() in the GCN JS API has changed.

It will no longer support calls like
<shell>
page.createTag([construct], [magicvalue], [success], [error]);
</shell>

Instead, the call has to written as

<shell>
page.createTag(
   {
      constructId: [construct],
      magicValue: [magicvalue]
   }, [success], [error]);
</shell>

(parameters specifying what tag has to be created have to be given as object).

The REST-API method <code>/CNPortletapp/rest/page/newtag/{id}</code> now also supports creation of a tag as copy of another tag (in the same page or in another page).

----

Added option "update" to REST API calls for loading folders, images or files
to load them for the purpose of updating. Currently, folders, iamges and files
are not locked in the backend, but it is still recommended to set the "update"
parameter to true, when the returned object shall be modified. This will ensure
that the object contains all possible object tags, even if they are not yet filled.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/enhancement_24.png! *Enhancement*

Modified the Gentics Content.Node Javascript API to load also folders, images and
files for updating them. This will ensure that the API objects will have all
possible object tags set (even if they are not yet filled in the backend).

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix RT#51544*

When creating new files using the REST API, the returned file will now contain all possible object tags.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix RT#51584*

Changed the status message displayed when running a data check of a contentrepository that is not linked with any nodes.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix RT#51673*

Fixed a bug that caused folders created in a derived node over the Rest API to be added to the wrong node.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix RT#48547*

----

The flash uploader button will now also work in nativ Internet Explorer 9 mode. Previously the flash uploader was not working due to Internet Explorer 9 security options regarding flash applications.

----


h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Fixed behaviour of assistant history to be consistent with multichannelling. This
also fixes creation of "hidden" pages if creating new pages directly after switching
into a folder of another node using the assistant history.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Adds addDeleteButton() to Aloha Blocks to allow implementors to dynamically add
a delete button to a GCN Aloha Block even if the block had originally been
determined to be un-deletable.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Fixed javascript error that occured when leaving the tagtype/node assignment dialog. Previously jquery was loaded twice and that caused a javascript error while initialising the tipsy tooltips in the tagtype list.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

A image include within the page property view was fixed.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Multiple javascript errors within the adminstrativ interface were fixed. Previously the tooltip plugin caused javascript errors within the tagfill dialog when a new tagtype was created. jQuery 1.4.2 was replaced with jQuery 1.6.1 in various places. Live editor page editing will still use jQuery 1.4.2 due to compatibility reasons.
----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

A missing image was added to the imagemanipulation2. Previously the image resize handle image was not loaded. 

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

The image manipulation 'Ok' button behaviour was fixed. Previously the button click would not work within Internet Explorer 7 due to missing json extensions of that browser.  

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Some messages for the file uploader will now be displayed in the correct langauge.
