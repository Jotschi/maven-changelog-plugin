The GCN JS API api methods have been made more error resilient.  It was
previously the case the exceptions that occurred during the invocation of
callback functions that were passed to the GCN JS API by the user of the
library would prevent the library from completing any further calls that it has
in is call queue; content objects would be left in unusable state from there
on. The enhancement provides and internal means to allow the library to catch
exceptions that occur in user-given callbacks so that the library is able to
continue processing its queued invocations.

Added support to the GCN JS API for dealing with property names that have dots in them.  Such
support is especially needed in order to deal with object property tags which
have names like "object.myprop".
