A velocity inline scope setting was turned off because it may cause too much memory consumption.
    
If the following Velocity setting is activated, macros will be saved in the namespace for each tag instead of the global namespace. Velocity apparently doesn't clean up namespaces, which will cause too much memory consumption if there are many tags that use macros.

A new page diff algorithm was introduced:

The new Daisydiff algorithm can be enabled through the feature "useDaisyDiff".
It will than replace the standard linear-diff algorithm.

The difference between the algorithms is that the Daisydiff algorithm
tries hard to preserve the tree-structure of the HTML page, while the
linear diff will not.
