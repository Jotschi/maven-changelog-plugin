h2. Changes with Gentics Content.Node 5.4.14

endprologue.

----

WARNING: *Manual Change* The tagfill dialog will now only contain jquery version 1.6.1. 

Previously two different jquery versions were loaded. This change may affect existing custom form tagtype implementations. Please note that loading a second jquery version by means of a custom form tag may cause unexpected issues with existing javascript features of Gentics Content.Node. We suggest using the new jquery version 1.6.1.

Fixed the old singlefile Content.Node 4 Uploader not taking file extensions with numbers in account.

Fixed filling of tags with the new Minibrowser in the tagfill dialog when multichannelling is used: When an item is selected in the Minibrowser, the form will be posted and the tagfill dialog re-rendered.
This is necessary for custom form tag implementations that need to be re-rendered whenever some other parts change.

----

A logout link was added to the selfupdate dialog. It is now advised to logout and login again after the update was completed. This step ensures that the interface of the update user will be loaded correctly after the system was updated.
