h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

Fixed missing CHANGELOG type (SQL) in system.CHANGELOG and some missing ';'. Those issues caused a problem with database updates. The previously missing database update did not affect operation since it was just a regular performance optimisation.
