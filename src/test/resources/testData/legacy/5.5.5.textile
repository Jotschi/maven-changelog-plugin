The Rest API construct/list method will now be used by the Gentics Content.Node JavaScript API. Previously the construct/load method was used. The json format for the success handler of getConstructs and getConstructCategories was changed.

Fixed exporting and importing assignment between Object Tag Definitions and Nodes.
Export bundles, that were created on systems using the new Export mechanism before this bugfix might be incompatible with Systems still using the old Import mechanism:
Importing might fail with an "Internal Error". In such cases, the Export bundle should be recreated with this fix applied.

A NullPointerException within the RestAPI is now handled. Previously a NPE occured when trying to save a page using a request object that contained tags without specifying the *name* attribute of the tag. We now throw an exception in those cases.
