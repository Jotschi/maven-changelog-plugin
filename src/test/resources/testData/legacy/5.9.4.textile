A SGB error within the construct tagfill view was fixed. Previously the value of an image url part type could not be set. This issue was introduced in 5.9.0.

Fixed the construct list method response for channel nodes. Previously a construct list call for a channel would reveal an empty list. Now the constructs for the master node will returned when a channel node_id was specified for the list request.
