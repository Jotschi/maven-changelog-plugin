WARNING: *Manual Change* Removed handling of magic image blocks. This affects the handling of gtxalohaimage tags. The inline image block handling and editing was replaced with the new <a href="http://www.gentics.com/Content.Node/infoportal/cms/wiki/Imagemanipulation2.en.php">imagemanipulation2 feature</a>. This change is only required when the feature aloha010 is enabled.

Please update the gtxalohapagelink tag-type according to <a href="http://gentics.com/Content.Node/infoportal/cms/Does-the-Aloha-Link-plugin-support-internal-links.en.php"> this definition</a>.

Fixed a css bug with editicons in Firefox, where icons would have an unwanted offset. Also added zero border with to images within tagicons to prevent them from being outlined when inside an anchor tag. Therefore the following css classes have been changed: ".GENTICS_block .aloha-editicons button" (added borders and background) and .GENTICS_block .aloha-editicons button img (added border 0px).

Entering a width or height in the imagemanipulation2 image size fields sometimes led to a reduction of the image size. Values that exceed the bounds of the image will now be correctly reduced to the defined limits of the image manipulation2. The aspect ratio will be preserved correctly.

The type of objects which are listed in the URL field of the link plugin, and in the repository-browser, can now be configured in the node.conf.

$ALOHA_SETTINGS['plugins']['link']['objectTypeFilter'] = array('website');
</shell>

The repository browser will list files in addition to pages:

<shell>
$ALOHA_SETTINGS['plugins']['gcn-linkbrowser']['objectTypeFilter'] = array('website', 'files');
</shell>

The Aloha Editor's format plugin functionality "removeFormat" may now be configured to remove more than the standard set of formattings. By default it will only remove the following html tags: 'strong', 'em', 'b', 'i', 'cite', 'q', 'code', 'abbr', 'del', 'sub', 'sup'. You can however provide a different set of tags to be removed by adding your configuration as an array to the format plugin's Aloha settings:

<shell>
$ALOHA_SETTINGS['plugins']['format']['removeFormats'] = array('strong', 'em', 'b', 'i', 'cite', 'h1', 'h2', 'h3');
</shell>

Fixed: Clean-up of Aloha editables during initialization

Earlier, the generic and the santize content-handler were used to
clean-up an editable when it was initialized. Now, no clean-up will be
performed on initialization.

In particular, the generic content-handler performed transformations
like turning a strong tag into a b tag, which was undesired.

----

The #nodeViews container in the assistant frame was set to a fixed width.

When using the Repository Browser in Aloha to find pages, the sorting of folders was different than in the tree: folders starting with '[' were sorted first in the Repository Browser, while they are sorted last in the tree. This has been fixed now, the sorting should be identical now.

----

h4. !images/changelog_types/bugfix_24.png! *Bugfix*

When using the DiffResource of the REST API to calculate diffs between given HTML codes, using either method diff/html or diff/source, the templates used to render differences are now restricted to accessing Object Properties. It is no longer possible to invoke Methods of objects.
