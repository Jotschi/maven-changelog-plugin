Fixed bug that occured when uploading a file with the flash uploader. Internet Explorer 7 in combination with some versions of flash (incl. 11.1) previously passed cookie values to flash. The uploader will now no longer fail when a session secret previously was set using the passed cookie. Newer browsers won't pass the cookie because it was set to httponly uppon creation.
